        <div>We will process your personal information lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner. We collect and process information about you only where we have legal bases for doing so.</div>
        <div>These legal bases depend on the services you use and how you use them, meaning we collect and use your information only where:</div>
        <div>It’s necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party or to take steps at your request before entering into such a contract (for example, when we provide a service you request from us);</div>
        <div>It satisfies a legitimate interest (which is not overridden by your data protection interests), such as for research and development, to market and promote our services, and to protect our legal rights and interests;</div>
        <div>You give us consent to do so for a specific purpose (for example, you might consent to us sending you our newsletter); or</div>
        <div>We need to process your data to comply with a legal obligation.</div>
        <div>Where you consent to our use of information about you for a specific purpose, you have the right to change your mind at any time (but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place).</div>
        <div>We do not keep personal information for longer than is necessary. While we retain this information, we will protect it within commercially acceptable means to prevent loss and theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use or modification.
